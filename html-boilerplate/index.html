        <h1> Hello World!</h1>
        <p>We must use this tag to creat paragraphs. The browser compresses new lines into a single long line. If our website contains paragraphs of data this tag is invaluable.</p>
        <p>Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder to signify they are headings. The "Hello World" at the top of this page is one example, but several more will be show below. H1 through H6 are used to change the size of headings with H1 being the largest.</p>
        <h1>This is a heading 1.</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading 2.</h2>
        <h3>This is a heading 3.</h3>
        <h4>This is a heading 4.</h4>
        <h5>This is a heading 5.</h5>
        <h6>This is a heading 6.</h6>
        <p>The strong element makes text bold. It makes readers aware that the text is important. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text with the strong tag. The strong tag can be used on its own similar the the paragraph tag.</p>
        <strong>This is an example of the strong tag.</strong>
        <p>The em element makes text italic. It places emphasis on the text in a different manner than strong. In some cases it may be used to convey unspoken thoughts or sarcasm. Em can be used on its own as well.</p>
        <em>Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.</em>
        <p>Indenting elements wtihin other elements is called nesting. When we nest elements we create a parent/child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children. We have used nesting so far to create this web page.</p>
        <p>Comments are not visible in the browser, and are used to make future additions easier for other developers or our future selves. It gives us a point to jump off from with what we were trying to accomplish.</p>

        <p>Unordered lists contain bullet points because the order of the items does not matter. One example of an unordered list could be your grocery list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ordered lists by contrast contain numbers because the order does matter. An example of an ordered list is a list of  your top 5 favorite video games.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
