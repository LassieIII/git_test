        <h1> Hello World!</h1>
        <p>We must use this tag to creat paragraphs. The browser compresses new lines into a single long line. If our website contains paragraphs of data this tag is invaluable.</p>
        <p>Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder to signify they are headings. The "Hello World" at the top of this page is one example, but several more will be show below. H1 through H6 are used to change the size of headings with H1 being the largest.</p>
        <h1>This is a heading 1.</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading 2.</h2>
        <h3>This is a heading 3.</h3>
        <h4>This is a heading 4.</h4>
        <h5>This is a heading 5.</h5>
        <h6>This is a heading 6.</h6>
        <p>The strong element makes text bold. It makes readers aware that the text is important. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text with the strong tag. The strong tag can be used on its own similar the the paragraph tag.</p>
        <strong>This is an example of the strong tag.</strong>
        <p>The em element makes text italic. It places emphasis on the text in a different manner than strong. In some cases it may be used to convey unspoken thoughts or sarcasm. Em can be used on its own as well.</p>
        <em>Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.</em>
        <p>Indenting elements wtihin other elements is called nesting. When we nest elements we create a parent/child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children. We have used nesting so far to create this web page.</p>
        <p>Comments are not visible in the browser, and are used to make future additions easier for other developers or our future selves. It gives us a point to jump off from with what we were trying to accomplish.</p>

        <p>Unordered lists contain bullet points because the order of the items does not matter. One example of an unordered list could be your grocery list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ordered lists by contrast contain numbers because the order does matter. An example of an ordered list is a list of  your top 5 favorite video games.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Anchor elements are how we create links in HTML. Anchor elements create the text of the link, and have a reference to where the link will take you.</p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" alt="The Odin Project Logo">click me</a>
        <!--href tells the link where to take you and gives the link its distinctive blue color-->
        <p>Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Links ot pages on other websites on the internet</li>
                <li>Links to pages located on our own websites</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Aboslute links are links to pages on other websites on the internet. A typical absolute link has the following syntax: [protocol]://[domain]/[path]. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination. An example of an absolute link is the one we just created to the Odin Project website.</p>    
        <p>Relative link are links to other pages within our own website. These links do not include the domain name since it is another page in the same site. Relative links only include the file path to the other page <em>relative</em> to the page you are creating the link on. An example will be shown below.</p>
        <a href="about.html">About</a>
        <p>Can you imagine a website with no images? Certainly not. HTML gives us several elements to display various kinds of media. the img tag is the most widely used of these. The img is self closing which means it does not need a closing tag. There is an attribute called src which tells the browser where the image file is located. Src works very similar to href. Here is an example using an absolute link to display Odin from the Odin Project! </p>
        <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
        <p>If we wanted to use an image in the about pagee that we have stored locally we would create a path to the parent directory of our pages and then to the images directory, finally we can point to the image we want to use.</p>
        <p>Every image should have an src attribute, but it should also have an alt attribute. The alt attribute is used to describe an image in case it cannot be loaded. It may also be used with screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired persons.</p>
